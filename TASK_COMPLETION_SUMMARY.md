## **Task 2: Prevent Joining Inactive Rooms** ✅

### **Room Validation System:**

#### 1. **Status Checking**
```typescript
// Before: Anyone could join any room
// After: Validates room status before allowing join

if (room.status === 'ended') {
  console.log('Room has ended, cannot join');
  return null; // Prevent joining
}
```

#### 2. **Enhanced Error Messages**

**Before:**
```
❌ "Invalid room code. Please check and try again."
```

**After:**
```
✅ "Room not found or has ended. Please check the code 
   or ask the Quiz Master for a new room."
```

**For QR Scanner:**
```
✅ "Room not found or has ended. Please scan again 
   or enter code manually."
```

#### 3. **Room Cleanup Utilities**

New file: `utils/roomCleanup.ts`

**Functions:**
- `cleanupOldRooms()` - Removes rooms older than 24 hours
- `getActiveRoomsCount()` - Counts currently active rooms
- `isRoomValid()` - Validates room status and age

**File:** `components/ConfirmDialog.tsx`

**Features:**
- 3 variants: danger, warning, info

/>
```

---

### **2. Custom Hooks**

useBeforeUnload(
  quizRoom?.status === 'active',
  'The quiz is in progress! Your progress will be lost.'
);
```

useNavigationWarning(
  enabled: boolean,
