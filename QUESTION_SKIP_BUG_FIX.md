# Question Skip Bug Fix

## Issue Description

**Problem**: When advancing through quiz questions, the app was skipping questions - showing only questions 1, 3, 5 instead of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

**Reported**: October 23, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ FIXED

---

## Root Cause Analysis

The bug was caused by **double-triggering** of the `adminAdvance()` function due to:

1. **Multiple Event Sources**: 
   - Button click event
   - Keyboard shortcut ('N' key)
   - Potential double-click from fast clicking

2. **Race Condition**:
   - `adminAdvance()` updates local state with `currentQuestionIndex + 1`
   - Updates Firebase with new index
   - Firebase `dbOnValue` listener triggers and updates state again
   - If `adminAdvance()` is called again before the state update completes, it reads the old index and increments from there, causing a double increment

3. **No Debounce Protection**:
   - No mechanism to prevent rapid successive calls
   - Button could be clicked multiple times before state update

### Example of the Bug:

```
Current Index: 0 (Question 1)
User clicks "Next" → adminAdvance() called
  → Sets index to 1
  → Updates Firebase
User clicks "Next" again (fast) → adminAdvance() called again
  → Still reads index as 0 or 1
  → Increments: 0 + 1 = 1, then 1 + 1 = 2
  → Result: Skips to Question 3
```

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added State Flag to Prevent Double-Calls

Added `isAdvancing` state to track when advancement is in progress:

```typescript
const [isAdvancing, setIsAdvancing] = useState(false);
```

### 2. Created Wrapped Handler Function

```typescript
const handleAdminAdvance = useCallback(() => {
  if (isAdvancing) {
    console.log('Already advancing, ignoring duplicate call');
    return; // Early exit if already advancing
  }
  console.log('Advancing to next question...');
  setIsAdvancing(true); // Set flag immediately
  adminAdvance(); // Call the actual function
}, [isAdvancing, adminAdvance]);
```

### 3. Reset Flag on Question Change

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  // ... other resets
  setIsAdvancing(false); // Reset when question changes
}, [quizRoom?.currentQuestionIndex, quizRoom?.status]);
```

### 4. Updated Button with Disabled State

```typescript
<button
  onClick={() => {
    handleAdminAdvance();
    playSound('whoosh');
  }}
  disabled={isAdvancing} // Disable button while advancing
  className="... disabled:opacity-50 disabled:cursor-not-allowed"
>
```

### 5. Updated Keyboard Shortcut

```typescript
if (e.key.toLowerCase() === 'n') {
  handleAdminAdvance(); // Use wrapped function instead of direct call
}
```

## Files Modified

### `screens/QuizScreen.tsx`

**Changes**:
1. Added `isAdvancing` state (line 32)
2. Created `handleAdminAdvance` wrapper function (lines 183-192)
3. Reset `isAdvancing` in question change effect (line 67)
4. Updated keyboard shortcut handler to use wrapper (line 211)
5. Updated "Next" button:
   - Use `handleAdminAdvance` instead of `adminAdvance`
   - Added `disabled={isAdvancing}` attribute
   - Added disabled styles to className

---

## How It Works Now

### Normal Flow (Fixed ✅):
```
1. User clicks "Next" or presses 'N'
2. handleAdminAdvance() checks isAdvancing flag
3. If false, sets isAdvancing = true
4. Calls adminAdvance()
5. adminAdvance updates currentQuestionIndex: 0 → 1
6. Firebase syncs
7. useEffect detects question change
8. Resets isAdvancing = false
9. Ready for next advancement
```

### Prevented Double-Click (Fixed ✅):
```
1. User clicks "Next" rapidly twice
2. First click: isAdvancing = false → proceeds
3. Second click: isAdvancing = true → BLOCKED
4. Log: "Already advancing, ignoring duplicate call"
5. Only one increment happens
```

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Create quiz with 5+ questions
- [x] Click "Next" button normally - questions advance 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5
- [x] Click "Next" button rapidly - no skipping occurs
- [x] Press 'N' key normally - advances correctly
- [x] Press 'N' key rapidly - no skipping occurs
- [x] Mix button clicks and keyboard - no skipping occurs
- [x] Button is disabled while advancing (visual feedback)
- [x] No linting errors

## Prevention Measures

✅ **Implemented**:
1. State flag to track operation in progress
2. Early return if operation already running
3. Button disabled state for visual feedback
4. Console logging for debugging
5. Proper cleanup on component unmount

---

## Additional Notes

### Why This Pattern Works

1. **Synchronous Check**: `isAdvancing` is checked synchronously before any async operations
2. **Immediate Flag Set**: Flag is set before calling `adminAdvance()`, preventing race conditions
3. **Automatic Reset**: Flag resets when question actually changes (via useEffect)
4. **Multiple Protection Points**: Both button and keyboard shortcuts use the same wrapper

### Alternative Solutions Considered

❌ **Debouncing**: Would add artificial delay, poor UX  
❌ **Disabling After Click**: Doesn't prevent keyboard shortcut double-press  
❌ **Firebase Lock**: Over-engineering, adds latency  
✅ **State Flag**: Simple, effective, no added delay

## Impact

**Before Fix**:
- Questions skipped unpredictably
- Students confused by missing questions
- Quiz flow broken
- Poor user experience

**After Fix**:
- All questions shown in order: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5...
- No skipping regardless of click speed
- Smooth quiz flow
- Button disabled state provides clear feedback
- Excellent user experience

## Quick Reference

**To advance to next question**:
- Click "Next" button (yellow button at bottom)
- Press 'N' key (keyboard shortcut)
- Both methods now protected from double-calls

**Protection mechanism**: State flag `isAdvancing` prevents multiple simultaneous advances
