# 🏢 SaaS Production-Ready Fixes

**Solution:**
- Added 1-second delay before enabling navigation warning
- Implemented `isNavigating` flag to prevent multiple triggers
- Fixed `useNavigationWarning` hook logic

**Files Modified:**
- `screens/LobbyScreen.tsx`
- `hooks/useBeforeUnload.tsx`

---

### 🐛 **Issue #2: Multiple Active Rooms** - FIXED  
**Problem:** Admin could create multiple rooms while having an active room

**Solution:**
- Added active room detection before creating new room
- Implemented warning dialog: "Active Room Detected"
- Option to close current room or keep it
- Automatic cleanup of previous room when creating new one

**Files Modified:**
- `screens/AdminDashboardScreen.tsx`
- `components/AdminSidebar.tsx`

---

## 🎯 New Features Implemented

### **1. Active Room Detection**

```typescript
const hasActiveRoom = quizRoom && 
  (quizRoom.status === 'waiting' || quizRoom.status === 'active');
```

**Behavior:**
- Checks if admin has active room before allowing new room creation
- Shows warning dialog with room details
- Prevents accidental multiple rooms

### **2. Smart Room Closure**

```typescript
const handleCloseActiveRoom = () => {
  if (quizRoom) {
    cancelQuiz('Quiz Master started a new quiz session.');
    showToast('Previous room closed successfully', 'success');
  }
  setShowActiveRoomWarning(false);
  setTimeout(() => {
    handleCreateRoom();
  }, 100);
};
```

**Features:**
- Notifies all students in current room
- Cleans up previous room
- Creates new room automatically

### **3. Sidebar Navigation Protection**

```typescript
const handleNavClick = (key: string) => {
  if (key === 'admin_dashboard' && hasActiveRoom && onActiveRoomWarning) {
    onActiveRoomWarning();
    return;
  }
  onNavigate(key);
};
```

**Protection:**
- Prevents navigation to dashboard from active room
- Shows warning if attempted
- Maintains quiz integrity
