# 🛡️ Logo Click Exit Warning Feature

**Date**: October 23, 2025  
**Commit**: `066b996`  
**Status**: ✅ Live on GitHub

## Issue Reported

**Problem**: When users (admin or students) clicked the ArenaQuest logo in the header during an active quiz, they were immediately redirected to the landing page without any warning, causing:
- Accidental quiz exits
- Lost progress for students
- Unintentional room closures for admins
- Disconnected students when admin left

**User Request**: "We have adapted not exit that prevent by mistaked exit or close in user and admin mode both but all working only one things when i click main logo then it will redirect to main page that should also be showing that messages"

---

## Solution Implemented

Added confirmation dialog when clicking the ArenaQuest logo during active quiz sessions.

### How It Works:

1. **Detection**: Checks if there's an active `quizRoom` and user is in quiz-related screens (`lobby`, `quiz`, or `results`)

2. **Warning Dialog**: Shows contextual confirmation based on user role:
   - **Admin**: "Leave Quiz Room?" with warning about disconnecting students
   - **Student**: "Leave Quiz?" with warning about lost progress

3. **Safe Exit**: 
   - If admin confirms: Cancels quiz with message to students
   - If student confirms: Simply leaves the quiz
   - If either cancels: Stays in current screen

4. **Normal Behavior**: If no active quiz, clicking logo navigates to landing page directly

## Implementation Details

### File Modified
**`components/Header.tsx`**

### Changes Made:

#### 1. Added Imports
```typescript
import { Screen, useQuiz } from '../hooks/useQuiz';
import ConfirmDialog from './ConfirmDialog';
```

#### 2. Added State & Context
```typescript
const { quizRoom, cancelQuiz } = useQuiz();
const [showExitDialog, setShowExitDialog] = useState(false);
```

#### 3. Modified Logo Click Handler
```typescript
<div 
  className="flex items-center space-x-2 lg:space-x-3 cursor-pointer group"
  onClick={() => {
    // Check if there's an active quiz room
    if (quizRoom && (screen === 'lobby' || screen === 'quiz' || screen === 'results')) {
      // Show confirmation dialog before leaving
      setShowExitDialog(true);
    } else {
      setScreen('landing');
    }
  }}
>
```

#### 4. Added Confirmation Dialog
```typescript
<ConfirmDialog
  isOpen={showExitDialog}
  title={isAdmin ? "Leave Quiz Room?" : "Leave Quiz?"}
  message={
    isAdmin 
      ? "You're currently in an active quiz room. If you leave now, the room will be closed and all students will be disconnected. Are you sure you want to leave?"
      : "You're currently in an active quiz. If you leave now, your progress will be lost. Are you sure you want to leave?"
  }
  confirmText={isAdmin ? "Close Room & Leave" : "Yes, Leave Quiz"}
  cancelText="Stay Here"
  variant="danger"
  onConfirm={() => {
    // Cancel/end the quiz if admin
    if (isAdmin && quizRoom) {
      cancelQuiz('Quiz Master has left the room. Quiz cancelled.');
    }
    setShowExitDialog(false);
    setScreen('landing');
  }}
  onCancel={() => {
    setShowExitDialog(false);
  }}
/>
```

**Triggers**: Browser close, refresh, back button

### 2. Sidebar Navigation Warning  
**Location**: `LobbyScreen.tsx`
**Uses**: `useNavigationWarning` hook
**Triggers**: Sidebar button clicks

### 3. Logo Click Warning (NEW)
**Location**: `Header.tsx`

**All three work together** to prevent accidental quiz exits! 🛡️

## Technical Notes

### Why Check Specific Screens?
```typescript
if (quizRoom && (screen === 'lobby' || screen === 'quiz' || screen === 'results'))
```

- **`quizRoom`**: Ensures there's an active room
- **Screen check**: Only protects quiz-related screens
- **Excludes**: Landing, home, auth screens (intentional navigation)

### Why Different Messages?
```typescript
title={isAdmin ? "Leave Quiz Room?" : "Leave Quiz?"}
```

- **Admin**: Emphasizes room closure and student impact
- **Student**: Focuses on personal progress loss
- **Clarity**: Role-specific consequences

### Why Cancel Quiz for Admin?
```typescript
if (isAdmin && quizRoom) {
  cancelQuiz('Quiz Master has left the room. Quiz cancelled.');
}
```

- **Clean closure**: Properly ends the quiz
- **Student notification**: Everyone gets the message
- **Data integrity**: Prevents orphaned rooms
- **Professional**: Transparent communication

---

## Summary

✅ **Issue**: Logo click caused accidental quiz exits without warning  
✅ **Solution**: Added confirmation dialog with role-specific messaging  
✅ **Result**: Comprehensive exit protection across all navigation methods  
✅ **Status**: Production ready and deployed  

**Impact**: Greatly improved user experience with multiple safety mechanisms to prevent accidental quiz exits! 🎉
