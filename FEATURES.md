## 🔐 Security Notes

⚠️ **Important**: Currently Firebase config is client-side. For production:
1. Add Firebase Realtime Database Rules in Firebase Console
2. Implement authentication for admin actions
3. Validate data structure server-side
4. Rate limit room creation

Example minimal rules:
```json
{
  "rules": {
    "rooms": {
      "$roomId": {
        ".read": true,
        ".write": "auth != null"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## 🎯 Next Steps / Enhancements

- [ ] Add authentication (Firebase Auth)
- [ ] Export results to CSV/PDF
- [ ] Add more quiz modes (true/false, text input, image-based)
- [ ] Admin dashboard for historical data
- [ ] Custom themes/branding
- [ ] Sound effects and music
- [ ] Multi-language support
- [ ] Room expiration (auto-cleanup old rooms)
- [ ] Student join queue (approve before entering)
- [ ] Chat/reactions during quiz

## 🐛 Known Issues / Limitations

- No offline support (requires internet)
- Room codes are random (not memorable words)
- No edit-in-place for created quizzes
- Large rooms (100+ students) may need optimization
- Timer sync depends on client system time

## 📱 Browser Support

- ✅ Chrome/Edge (recommended)
- ✅ Firefox
- ✅ Safari (iOS/macOS)
- ⚠️ IE11 (not supported)
