# Color-Coded Option System 🎨

## Student View - What Students See

Students only see **4 large colored buttons** with unique symbols. No question text is displayed - the question is shown on the projector by the admin.

### The 4 Options:

```
┌─────────────────────┬─────────────────────┐
│   ● RED    (A)      │   ■ YELLOW  (B)     │
│                     │                     │
│   Large Red Button  │   Large Yellow Btn  │
│   with Circle       │   with Square       │
└─────────────────────┴─────────────────────┘
┌─────────────────────┬─────────────────────┐
│   ▲ GREEN  (C)      │   ★ BLUE   (D)      │
│                     │                     │
│   Large Green Btn   │   Large Blue Btn    │
│   with Triangle     │   with Star         │
└─────────────────────┴─────────────────────┘
```

### Color & Symbol Mapping:

| Option | Color  | Symbol | CSS Class       |
|--------|--------|--------|-----------------|
| **A**  | 🔴 Red    | ●      | bg-red-500      |
| **B**  | 🟡 Yellow | ■      | bg-yellow-400   |
| **C**  | 🟢 Green  | ▲      | bg-green-500    |
| **D**  | 🔵 Blue   | ★      | bg-blue-500     |

## Visual States

### 1. Waiting State (Question Not Open)
- All buttons are **gray and disabled**
- Message shows: "⏳ Waiting for question to open..."
- No interaction possible

### 2. Active State (Accepting Answers)

### 3. Submitted State

## Admin View - What Admin Sees on Projector

Admin screen shows:
1. **Full question text** at the top
2. **All 4 colored options** with symbols, labels (A/B/C/D), and full text
3. **Correct answer badge** - Yellow "✓ CORRECT" tag on the right answer
4. When revealed: Correct answer gets **yellow ring** and **checkmark animation**

### Admin Controls:
- ▶️ **Open** - Starts timer, enables student answers
- ⏸️ **Close** - Stops accepting answers
- 👁️ **Reveal** - Highlights correct answer with animation
- 📊 **Results** - View live leaderboard
- ⏭️ **Next/End** - Advance to next question

## How It Works in Practice

### Setup:
1. **Admin creates quiz** with manual entry or AI generation
2. Admin sets correct answer (A/B/C/D) for each question
3. Students join via room code

### During Quiz:
1. **Admin displays question on projector** (big screen everyone can see)
2. **Students look at projector** to read the question
3. Admin clicks **"Open"** - timer starts
4. **Students see 4 colored buttons** on their phones/devices
5. Students tap their chosen color:
   - 🔴 Red (A)
   - 🟡 Yellow (B)
   - 🟢 Green (C)
   - 🔵 Blue (D)
6. Admin can **"Close"** to stop late submissions
7. Admin **"Reveals"** answer - correct color highlighted on projector
8. Students see results on leaderboard
