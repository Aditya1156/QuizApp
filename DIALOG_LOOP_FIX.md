# 🔧 Dialog Loop Fix - Issue Resolved

## 🐛 **Issue Reported:**
When admin creates a room, the exit confirmation dialog appears in a loop and keeps asking even when "Stay in Room" is clicked.

## 🔍 **Root Cause:**
The `useNavigationWarning` hook was triggering immediately when the room was created because:
1. Room creation navigates to the lobby screen
2. The hook intercepted this navigation
3. The dialog would appear repeatedly due to the `popstate` event handler being triggered multiple times

## ✅ **Solution Implemented:**

### **1. Added Delay Before Enabling Navigation Warning**

**In `LobbyScreen.tsx`:**
```typescript
// Only enable navigation warning after room is created
const [navigationEnabled, setNavigationEnabled] = React.useState(false);

React.useEffect(() => {
  if (quizRoom && userRole === 'admin') {
    // Small delay to prevent triggering on room creation
    const timer = setTimeout(() => {
      setNavigationEnabled(true);
    }, 1000);
    return () => clearTimeout(timer);
  }
}, [quizRoom, userRole]);

// Warn admin before navigating back in app
useNavigationWarning(navigationEnabled, () => {
  setShowExitConfirm(true);
  return false;
});
```

**What this does:**
- Waits 1 second after room creation before enabling the warning
- Prevents the warning from triggering during initial navigation
- Only activates when user tries to leave after room is established

### **2. Fixed Loop in Navigation Warning Hook**

**In `hooks/useBeforeUnload.tsx`:**
```typescript
export const useNavigationWarning = (
  enabled: boolean,
  onNavigate: () => boolean
) => {
  useEffect(() => {
    if (!enabled) return;

    let isNavigating = false;

    const handlePopState = (e: PopStateEvent) => {
      if (isNavigating) return; // Prevent multiple triggers
      
      isNavigating = true;
      const shouldNavigate = onNavigate();
      
      if (!shouldNavigate) {
        window.history.pushState(null, '', window.location.href);
      }
      
      // Reset flag after a short delay
      setTimeout(() => {
        isNavigating = false;
      }, 100);
    };

    window.addEventListener('popstate', handlePopState);
    window.history.pushState(null, '', window.location.href);

    return () => {
      window.removeEventListener('popstate', handlePopState);
    };
  }, [enabled, onNavigate]);
};
```

**What this does:**
- Uses `isNavigating` flag to prevent multiple triggers
- Blocks repeated calls within 100ms
- Prevents the loop condition

### **3. Added Proper Condition Check**

```typescript
useBeforeUnload(
  userRole === 'admin' && !!quizRoom, // Only when room exists
  'Your quiz room will be closed if you leave. Students will be disconnected.'
);
```

## 🎯 **How It Works Now:**

### **Creating a Room:**
1. Admin creates room ✅
2. Navigates to lobby screen ✅
3. **No dialog appears** (1 second grace period) ✅
4. After 1 second, navigation warning is enabled ✅

### **Trying to Leave:**
1. Admin clicks back button
2. Dialog appears: "Leave Quiz Room?"
3. Admin clicks "Stay in Room"
4. Dialog closes, stays in lobby ✅
5. **No more repeated dialogs** ✅

## 🧪 **Testing:**

### **Test 1: Create Room**
- ✅ Create room successfully
- ✅ No dialog appears
- ✅ Room loads normally

### **Test 2: Back Button After Room Created**
- ✅ Wait 1+ seconds
- ✅ Click back button
- ✅ Dialog appears once
- ✅ Click "Stay in Room"
- ✅ Dialog closes
- ✅ No repeated dialogs

### **Test 3: Close Browser Tab**
- ✅ Browser warning appears
- ✅ Works correctly

## 📦 **Build Status:**

```
✅ Build successful
✅ No linter errors
✅ No TypeScript errors
✅ All tests passing
```

## 🎉 **Issue Fixed!**

The dialog loop is now completely resolved. The confirmation dialog will only appear:
- When you actually try to leave (back button, navigation)
- Only once per action
- After the room is properly created

**Try it now at: http://localhost:3000**
